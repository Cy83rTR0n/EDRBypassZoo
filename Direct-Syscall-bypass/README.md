## Would be adding documentation and details regarding the attack
### Resources used for this are as follows :

1. https://github.com/jackullrich/syscall-detect (The beotm project is inspired from this, since the first release version is not able to catch it we will be using this to create our required POC).
2. https://github.com/1401199262/InstrumentationCallback/blob/master/InstrumentCallback/bypassAsm.asm (According to the blog regarding catching direct syscalls this is from the author tried to create his mitigation tactic).
3. https://winternl.com/detecting-manual-syscalls-from-user-mode/ (syscall-detect blog).
4. https://0xmaz.me/posts/HookChain-A-Deep-Dive-into-Advanced-EDR-Bypass-Techniques/ (this post does a lot of things together need to look at it).
