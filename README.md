## üöÄ Overview
EDRBypassZoo is a collection of proof-of-concept (PoC) implementations designed to evade various hooking mechanisms commonly employed by security products. It provides low-level techniques to restore original execution flow and bypass monitoring at different levels of the Windows operating system.

### üîç Features  
‚úÖ **IAT Hooking Bypass** ‚Äì Restores original API calls by evading Import Address Table (IAT) hooks.  
‚úÖ **Kernel32 Hooking Bypass** ‚Äì Bypasses userland hooks placed on Kernel32 functions to ensure unmonitored execution.  
‚úÖ **NT-Level Inline Hooking Bypass** ‚Äì Identifies and neutralizes inline hooks at the NT function level to restore original code execution.  
‚úÖ **Direct Syscall Bypass** ‚Äì Executes syscalls without relying on standard API calls, effectively circumventing direct syscall monitoring mechanisms.  
‚úÖ **Indirect Syscall Bypass** ‚Äì Leverages Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) to dynamically retrieve System Service Numbers (SSNs) and construct a legitimate execution stack, bypassing existing syscall detection strategies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details
HBS employs advanced techniques to ensure stealthy and reliable unhooking:
- **Restoring IAT Entries** ‚Äì Dynamically resolves API calls to their original addresses.
- **Syscall Stubs & Direct Execution** ‚Äì Bypasses userland monitoring by invoking syscalls directly.
- **Hook Detection & Removal** ‚Äì Identifies and eliminates inline patches in NT functions.
- **Memory Manipulation Techniques** ‚Äì Restores original function prologues to counter inline hooks.
